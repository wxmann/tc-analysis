Multiple tornadoes, including a few that were strong, very large hail and damaging winds accompanied the supercells that formed through the afternoon and evening. Over a dozen tornadoes occurred in northwest Oklahoma in addition to the numerous tornadoes in Kansas.||Much of Oklahoma remained under clear skies for the afternoon, which coupled with plentiful moisture allowed very strong instability to develop. A dryline stretched from western Kansas into northwest and western Oklahoma through the afternoon hours. Thunderstorms ignited off the dryline in the early afternoon, with the first severe weather reports around 230pm. The first tornado was not reported until nearly 4pm as low level wind shear increased gradually. The tornado reports continued through nearly 1am with the tornado that impacted Woodward, OK the last tornado of the evening.||With the first supercells firing around 2 PM, many dropped large hail, some as large as 3 inches in diameter. Many brief tornado touchdowns were reported as well, with the initial reports north of Woodward, OK. Additional supercells developed through the afternoon with a prominent tornadic supercell developing near Waynoka, Oklahoma. This supercell produced multiple tornadoes near Cherokee and continued moving to the northeast. One tornado with this supercell produced damage to a cemetery west of Byron. Fortunately, many of the tornadoes from this thunderstorm remained over mainly rural areas in Waynoka, Woods and Alfalfa counties.||Another tornadic supercell developed southwest of Woodward before midnight and tracked toward Woodward. The Woodward tornado began around 1150 PM roughly 3 miles northeast of Arnett and moved northeast into Woodward county. The southwest city limits of Woodward were impacted near 1218 AM on Sunday April 15th, 2012 and the tornado finally exited the north-northwest side of Woodward around 1223 AM.

However, considering that the entire area spent the day under its only High Risk convective outlook of the spring from the Storm Prediction Center, the situation could have been worse. No injuries were reported in this portion of North Central Kansas, and all significant, long-track tornadoes in the region remained just to the south across central and southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma. In the local area, the lone EF1 tornado touched down shortly after 2 PM CDT in western Mitchell County and tracked along a four-mile path just south of Tipton, destroying a few outbuilding and garages along the way. This tornado was rain-wrapped, and associated with a large high-precipitation supercell that moved northeast out of central Kansas. ||The first round of multiple severe storms lifted across the area from southwest to northeast mainly between 1130 AM and 330 PM CDT, with Mitchell County bearing the brunt of the activity. In addition to the tornado near Tipton, other storm reports included downed power lines near Glen Elder and estimated 60 MPH winds in Beloit. After these storms exited the area to the north and east, a lull of several hours ensued before the second round of scattered severe storms raced northward across the area between 730 PM and 10 PM CDT. Although these storms were not tornadic, severe weather reports included ping pong ball size hail in far southern Osborne County and quarter size hail in or near Phillipsburg, Kensington and Burr Oak, among other places. By 1030 PM CDT, storms had all but exited the local area for the night, although severe weather continued for nearby areas to the north, south and east. Although significant flooding was not an issue from this event, much of the area measured between 1-3 inches of rain, with one of the highest totals of 3.56 inches in Beloit. ||This severe weather outbreak was driven by a classic synoptic setup, as a powerful mid-upper level trough approached the Central Plains from the Four Corners region, featuring a 300 millibar jet streak in excess of 110 knots. At the surface, low pressure deepened over the course of the day, registering around 992 millibars by early evening over northwest Kansas. A well-defined warm front extended east from this low across south central Nebraska, as a sharpening dryline took shape along a line from southwest Nebraska to far western Oklahoma. With a strengthening and veering wind profile with height, shear parameters were quite supportive of significant severe weather. Around the time of the tornado near Tipton, mesoscale severe weather parameters featured around 2000 J/Kg mixed layer CAPE, 50-60 knots of deep layer vertical wind shear and 30-40 knots of surface-to-1 kilometer low level vertical shear. In addition, surface-to-1 kilometer storm relative helicity increased into at least the 300-500 m2/s2 range during the afternoon and evening hours, promoting a volatile environment for potentially strong, long-track tornadoes. Fortunately for this portion of North Central Kansas, most severe storms were less isolated than nearby tornadic supercells to the south, allowing storm scale interference to likely mitigate what could have been a more significant tornado event. ||On a regional and even national level, this was one of the most anticipated and well-advertised Central Plains tornado outbreaks ever. Although the majority of North Central Kansas was not in a High Risk outlook from the Storm Prediction Center until the early morning hours of the 14th, other parts of Kansas and Oklahoma were placed under a High Risk early on the 13th, marking the first time SPC ever issued a High Risk forecast so far in advance.","This tornado touched down approximately 3 miles south of Tipton, crossed Highway 181 before lifting approximately 1 mile southeast of Tipton.  Along its path, trees up to 4 ft in diameter were damaged or destroyed, outbuildings and garages were damaged or destroyed, homes suffered roof and siding damage and power poles were tipped or blown down completely.

However, considering that the entire area spent the day under its only High Risk convective outlook of the spring from the Storm Prediction Center, the situation could have been worse. No injuries were reported in South Central Nebraska, and all significant, long-track tornadoes in the region remained to the south across central and southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma. Locally, most severe weather targeted counties between Interstate 80 and the Kansas border. The first three brief tornadoes occurred between 2-3 PM CDT in Nuckolls and Thayer Counties, as a rain-wrapped supercell tracked out of northern Kansas. One of these tornadoes struck a farm just north of Alexandria, where a grain bin was toppled and a roof torn off a shed. A few hours later, the final and most-photographed tornado of the day touched down shortly after 6 PM CDT in Harlan County northeast of Oxford and crossed Highway 6, destroying a grain bin along the way. ||During this prolonged event, severe thunderstorms affected parts of the area for roughly 13 hours, mainly between 1030 AM and 1130 PM CDT. The first round of severe weather focused across northern portions of the area during the late morning as an elevated supercell tracked across parts of Sherman, Valley and Greeley Counties. This storm was a prolific hail producer, with hail of at least 2 inches in diameter causing considerable damage to homes and vehicles, especially north and west of Spalding. As these early storms exited to the northeast, the focus shifted south to near the Kansas border, as the next cluster of more-surface-based severe storms with embedded tornadic circulations lifted through primarily Nuckolls, Thayer and Fillmore Counties between 1-4 PM CDT. After a brief lull, a few more supercells fired up farther west around 5 PM CDT, with one of these storms producing the tornado near Oxford before weakening as it tracked northeast toward Kearney. Yet again, a brief lull ensued, before numerous severe thunderstorms flared up mainly south of Interstate 80 during the 830-1130 PM CDT time frame. Although these storms were not tornadic, multiple hail and wind reports included baseball size hail near Glenvil, golf ball size hail near Edison and McCool Junction and estimated 70 MPH winds and toppled irrigation center pivots near Campbell and east of Clay Center. Finally, between 1130 PM and 2 AM CDT, the remaining storms gradually weakened and exited the area to the east. ||Although significant flooding was not an issue, most areas southeast of a line from Osceola to Franklin measured at least 1-2 inches of rain, with 2-3 inch amounts most concentrated within Nuckolls, Thayer and Fillmore Counties, including a 3.70-inch total just west of Tobias along the Fillmore and Saline County line. ||This long-lasting severe weather outbreak was driven by a classic synoptic setup, as a powerful mid-upper level trough approached the Central Plains from the Four Corners region, featuring a 300 millibar jet streak in excess of 110 knots. At the surface, low pressure deepened over the course of the day, registering around 992 millibars by early evening over northwest Kansas.

Yet again, a brief lull ensued, before numerous severe thunderstorms flared up mainly south of Interstate 80 during the 830-1130 PM CDT time frame. Although these storms were not tornadic, multiple hail and wind reports included baseball size hail near Glenvil, golf ball size hail near Edison and McCool Junction and estimated 70 MPH winds and toppled irrigation center pivots near Campbell and east of Clay Center.

An upper level low pressure lifted northeast out of the southwest U.S.  The upper level center, as well as the surface low, passed northwest of Iowa, across southeast South Dakota into Minnesota.  Severe weather developed north of the warm front as it lifted north into Iowa.  A cluster of severe storms formed over northeast Kansas and southeast Nebraska.

EF2 damage occurred to the Greater Regional Medical Center and the Southwestern Community College campus. The tornado continued tracking to the northeast and damaged several farmsteads northeast of Creston before dissipating about 10 miles northeast of town at approximately 1815 CST.  The wind strength was estimated to be 130 MPH. Significant damage occurred with uninsured damage alone near $2,000,000.  A tornado touched down in Warren County east of New Virginia.  The tornado caused damage to farm buildings and campers with a considerable amount of sheet metal left lying around.  The EF1 tornado produced winds around 100 MPH.  Many of the thunderstorms brought with them high winds and hail.  The final tornado touched down in Mahaska County.  The tornado was an EF1 tornado with a broad and intense rear flank downdraft south of the track.  The AWOS site at the Oskaloosa airport in Mahaska County recorded a 97 MPH wind gust from the rear flank downdraft of the storm. Reports from the Emergency Manager indicated that damage at the airport was limited to two hangar doors and some damage to airport buildings.  There were no planes on the field at the time. Numerous reports of hail larger than quarter size were received.  Some of the larger hail included baseball size hail in Clarke County at Murray and numerous reports of golf ball size hail along the track of the severe cluster from Union County to Mahaska County.  The same cluster of storms also produced very strong winds along its path.  Numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds were received all along the path.  Numerous reports of tree and power line damage were received.  The Des Moines metro area was hard hit with winds of up to 65 MPH causing considerable tree damage.  At one time, 20,000 customers were reported without power.  In Marion County a garage was destroyed and a house significantly damaged by the wind east of Knoxville.   The storms also produced very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches was reported at several locations.  At the Des Moines International Airport, 1.10 inches of rain fell between 1630 and 1637 CST.  This amount of rainfall in that short of period of time was a 100 year event.

Multiple tornadoes, including a few that were strong, very large hail and damaging winds accompanied the supercells that formed through the afternoon and evening. Over a dozen tornadoes occurred in northwest Oklahoma in addition to the numerous tornadoes in Kansas.||Much of Oklahoma remained under clear skies for the afternoon, which coupled with plentiful moisture allowed very strong instability to develop. A dryline stretched from western Kansas into northwest and western Oklahoma through the afternoon hours. Thunderstorms ignited off the dryline in the early afternoon, with the first severe weather reports around 230pm. The first tornado was not reported until nearly 4pm as low level wind shear increased gradually. The tornado reports continued through nearly 1am with the tornado that impacted Woodward, OK the last tornado of the evening.||With the first supercells firing around 2 PM, many dropped large hail, some as large as 3 inches in diameter. Many brief tornado touchdowns were reported as well, with the initial reports north of Woodward, OK. Additional supercells developed through the afternoon with a prominent tornadic supercell developing near Waynoka, Oklahoma. This supercell produced multiple tornadoes near Cherokee and continued moving to the northeast. One tornado with this supercell produced damage to a cemetery west of Byron. Fortunately, many of the tornadoes from this thunderstorm remained over mainly rural areas in Waynoka, Woods and Alfalfa counties.||Another tornadic supercell developed southwest of Woodward before midnight and tracked toward Woodward.
