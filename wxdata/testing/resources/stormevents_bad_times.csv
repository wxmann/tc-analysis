This system dragged a warm front northeastward across central New York.  A southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.  Two large transmission towers near Nedrow were toppled from the winds and many buildings had blown out windows and/or roof damage.     Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.  New York State Electric and Gas Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power during the height of the storms late that afternoon and evening.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.","A tornadic supercell ripped across southern sections of the county between approximately 5:35 pm and 6:45 pm EDT.  Tornado intensities varied from F0 to F3 along this path.  Hailstones as large as baseballs and tea cups were also observed along the cell's southern and western flanks.       A tornado which affected Apalachin in southeastern Tioga county crossed the county line and into the town of Vestal around 5:35 pm EDT.  At this point, the tornado was rated as F0 intensity with the width of the damage path around 70 yards.  Damage was primarily to trees with some large trees uprooted and/or twisted off over hilltop sections.  As the cell moved further east into the town of Binghamton, the tornado intensified to category F2 with the damage width increasing to around 100 yards.  In this location, the damage became increasingly severe with more structures affected.  The local ABC affiliate in the town of Binghamton sustained major damage.  A 1000 foot television tower was twisted and toppled to the ground.  A large trash dumpster was lifted off the ground and tossed into two satellite dishes, then thrown about 100 yards further over an embankment.  A sport utility vehicle was rolled over several times as witnessed by a television crew member.  Another vehicle was also moved and a video tape was carried over a mile and a half away from the station.  Several small trailers were also flattened in Binghamton just east of Ingraham Hill and others had minor roof damage.  Two serious injuries occurred when a trailer collapsed upon the two female occupants who were in the kitchen at the time.      Between approximately 6:20 and 6:45 pm EDT, the tornado moved further east through Conklin, Kirkwood, Windsor, and eventually to the Sanford/Deposit area.  In the towns of Conklin and Kirkwood, the tornado maintained an F2 intensity.  More than a dozen homes took on damage as the twister moved through.  For the majority of these residences, damage was restricted to shingles and/or portions of the siding torn off or damaged from falling trees.  However, there were several trailers that were nearly or completely destroyed within the direct path of the tornado in the town of Conklin.  For one such trailer, its wreckage was strewn downstream for more than a quarter of a mile.  As the twister moved into the town of Windsor, it briefly weakened to F0 intensity.  At that point, touchdown locations appeared to be restriced to a few scattered spots with damage consisting of tree tops snapped or twisted off.     Once the tornado reached the town of Sanford, it reintensified and reached category F3.  A well built house was totally destroyed.  The only part of the structure left standing was a small interior closet.  Also, a wide swath of trees were flattened near a power company sub-station.  Trees were twisted off and blown in all directions with hundreds of them estimated to be toppled.  Local residents observed hail to 3 inches in diameter near the path of the tornado.  Fortunately, as the twister reached its greatest intensity, it affected areas that were more sparsely populated.       In all, county emergency management officials estimated damage totals near 1.5 million dollars.  Dozens of structures were severely damaged or destroyed and thousands of trees were cut down.  Twelve injuries were sustained in total with very fortunately no loss of life.  In some of the more remote areas, it took the better part of a week to restore power.  Two of the three local television affiliates were knocked off the air for a time on the evening of the 31st with several radio stations also suffering through service interruptions for up to three days.  The towns of Binghamton, Conklin, and Sanford were put under a local state of emergency and also ultimately declared federal disaster areas.",PDC

Then during the early morning hours of the 26th, a line of severe thunderstorms formed across southwest Oklahoma and raced eastward into southeast Oklahoma, resulting in widespread damage from winds estimated between 80 and 100 mph at times.","This tornado, rated F1, touched down about 5 miles east of Carmen about ? mile south of the intersection of EW29 Road and NS260 Road in Alfalfa County where scattered damage to trees was observed. At the intersection of EW29 Road and NS260 Road, very large limbs, some a foot or more in diameter, were blown off dozens of trees, while numerous other trees were pushed over. There was also damage to an oil storage tank made of metal. A telephone pole at the intersection was recently replaced and is assumed to have been downed during the tornado. A west to east chain link fence approximately 100 to 200 feet long was also downed southward. Major tree damage was then observed at a property about ? mile northeast of this location with many trees laying in a westward direction. A well-designed brick home near the trees, lost dozens perhaps hundreds of shingles, especially on the west side of the house. About 1 mile northeast of this location another house sustained a broken window on the north side of the house and minor roof damage, consisting mostly of missing roof shingles. Metal siding was partially peeled back from a nearby storage barn, and a medium-aged pine tree on the west side of the house was snapped halfway to the top. Near the intersection of EW27 Road and NS262 Road damage was observed to 2 metal barns. One barn had sheet metal peeled back on the roof and west and east sides. The roof of a storage building was also blown off in an eastward direction and left nearly intact on the ground. About ? to 1 mile north and east of this location a poorly constructed barn sustained minor roof and west-side wall damage, while another barn constructed of metal had its 2 west-facing doors blown inward and partially detached from its hinges.

The tropical storm moved steadily north across southeast Louisiana and by the afternoon of September 26 was located in central Mississippi downgraded to a tropical depression. Tropical Storm Isidore had a large circulation with tropical storm force winds extending several hundreds of miles from its center. Prior to moving onto the Yucatan Peninsula earlier in the week and weakening, Isidore was classified as a major hurricane.  Swells from the distant hurricane resulted in rip tides along the northern Gulf of Mexico, with a 41 year old man drowning on the afternoon of Sunday, Sept 22, 2002 at Port Fourchon, Lafouche Parish.    The large circulation caused a significant storm surge over a large area for a tropical storm. Tide levels were 4 to 6 feet above normal across much of southeast Louisiana from Grand Isle eastward to the Pearl River. Storm surge flooding occurred outside of the hurricane protection levees across Lafourche, Jefferson, Plaquemine, St. Bernard, and Orleans Parishes, inundating roadways and flooding some non-elevated structures. Across Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas, storm surge of 4 to 5 feet above normal were measured. Low lying areas, roadways and some non-elevated structures in parishes surrounding Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas were flooded. St. Tammany Parish was particularly hard hit with storm surge flooding when the Isidore moved north of the area, and the winds shifted to a southwest direction causing water levels to rapidly increase along the north shore  of Lake Pontchartrain on the morning of Thursday, September 26, 2000. The storm surge overtopped or breached a small local levee system in southern portions of Slidell causing water to flood several hundred homes.   Approximately 1000 homes were flooded in the parish from either storm surge, river flooding, or from flooding from heavy rainRainbands associated with Tropical Storm Isidore produced heavy rainfall in a wide area prior to and shortly after landfall. The greater New Orleans area, was particularly hard hit on the late afternoon and early evening Wednesday, September 25, 2002. Four to eight inches of rainfall occurred within 6 hours time. Drainage systems were overwhelmed by the heavy rain and numerous streets were flooded, automobiles were flooded, and water entered some homes. Portions of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes were also hard hit during the early morning of Thursday, September 26, 2002 with homes flooded when heavy rainfall overwhelmed drainage. Between 200 and 300 homes and businesses were reported flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Storm total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches were common across southeast Louisiana. Most areas recorded sustained winds of 35 to 45 mph with some gusts to 50 mph in sqaulls. The highest wind speeds were observed near the coast or tidal lakes.  Grand Isle, on the coast, recorded the highest wind gust of 71 mph.A tornado touched down near Golden Meadow, Lafourche Parish, where a couple of sheriff's office patrol cars were damaged along with several storage buildings.The Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness reported appoximately 2500 people sought refuge in approximately 40 shelters in the state. As of late November 2002, the Louisiana State Insurance Department reported that insurance industry has indicated that Tropical Storm Isidore had  resulted in $105 million in insured losses.

By the end of the day, one EF-5, two EF-4, and two EF-3 tornadoes destroyed buildings, ripped up trees and power poles, and unfortunately, resulted in 11 deaths. The day began with a strong upper level trough ejecting out of the southwest United States. The trough took on a negative tilt as it approached the southern Plains. A strong jet stream was located at both the middle and upper levels rotating around the upper trough. At the surface, a low pressure strengthened rapidly over northwest Oklahoma, keeping the low-level flow of warm, moist air to flow east of a dry line that had moved into western Oklahoma. Thunderstorms developed by early afternoon over western Oklahoma, and quickly became supercellular as they moved northeast. Strong low-level rotation developed early, with the first tornado occurring over Blaine county, and moved northeast into Major county. Another supercell rapidly gained low-level rotation as it moved from Caddo into Canadian County. This tornado became the strongest of them all as it moved north of El Reno, west of Piedmont, and to south of Guthrie in Logan county. Nine people died as a result of this tornado. Two more powerful supercells developed over Grady county, and they moved northeast into McClain and Cleveland counties. Finally, the final tornado occurred east of Norman into Pottawatomie county.

Three people died in vehicles near the I-40 Calumet exit, and two other fatalities occurred just northeast of that location. Cars were thrown thousands of feet off the roadways. It is believed that the tornado reached its maximum intensity just after crossing I-40, and it was here that a mobile radar measured winds of greater than 210 mph just off the surface. The El Reno Oklahoma Mesonet station (5 miles west) measured wind gusts of 131 and 151 mph. From this location, the tornado continued northeast, narrowly missing the town of Piedmont. Widespread EF-3, occasional EF-4 damage occurred between El Reno and Piedmont. More widespread EF-4 damage was seen west and north of Piedmont.
